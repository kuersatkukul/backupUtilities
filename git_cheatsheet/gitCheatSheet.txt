#Cheatsheet for common git operations

- Remove files added with git add <files>
  -> git rm -r --cached . (. means all files added)

- Add files but dry run (means it shows what would be added but does not add it, similar to perforce command line tools)
  -> git add -n <files>

- Remove dirs from repo
  -> 	git rm -r one-of-the-directories // This deletes from filesystem
	git commit . -m "Remove duplicated directory"
	git push origin <your-git-branch> (typically 'master', but not always)

To remove this directory from Git, but not delete it entirely from the filesystem (local):
  ->  	git rm -r --cached myFolder


Remove all file edits locally (i.e get latest revision from git)
  ->	git checkout -- filename.txt
